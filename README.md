## Document

The paper is still under review and only the code for visualisation has been given so far, the full code will be released after the paper is accepted. Train and test dataset can be downloaded by <a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Xw9w3dXDP1QcIRh8j2zM8w?pwd=sike">here</a>.

## visualisation

The visualisation section is placed in the 'visualisation' folder and the code can be run as follows to obtain a visualisation of the 'comic' for FDSR and FDSR wFDL at x2 upscale factor.

```
cd visualisation
python main.py
```
